# Python Extract Transform and Load (ETL) Project

## Overview

During my Python Data Analyst Certification with Wiley Edge, I embarked on a comprehensive project aimed at leveraging the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework to analyze and present data sourced from a government website. The primary objective was to organize, clean, and derive insights from the chosen dataset.

## Project Focus

**Dataset Selection:**  
For this project, I selected data related to the median and average housing prices in Connecticut spanning the years 2000 to 2022. The specific focus was on understanding how the financial crisis of 2008 influenced the housing market in the region.

## Objectives

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Retrieve relevant housing market data from the government website.
   - Ensure data completeness and accuracy.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Apply ETL techniques to organize and structure the data effectively.
   - Cleanse the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent information.

3. **Data Presentation:**
   - Utilize data visualization tools to present key findings.
   - Explore trends and patterns in median and average housing prices.

4. **Analysis and Insight:**
   - Investigate the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the Connecticut housing market.
   - Provide insights for investors, particularly regarding the correlation between total property value and associated risks.

## Project Significance

This project serves as a practical application of Python data analysis skills acquired during the certification. By delving into real-world data and addressing issues in cleaning and organization, I aimed to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of the housing market, especially during critical economic events.
